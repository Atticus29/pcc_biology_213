### Communication

Check D2L every day for course content. Use your PCC account for email. DO NOT USE D2L email as it does not get forwarded to my PCC inbox. It is PCC policy that we are to use PCC email for electronic communication about schoolwork or other college related business. You may also leave me a note at the office drop box  in room 7/TODO. I plan on checking my email daily. If you send me an important message and you don’t get a reply from me within two school days, please try again. It probably means I did not receive it. Please note that I won't accept as an excuse that email failed unless you are able to forward the message you sent.

## Instruction Materials

### Required

- Campbell, Neil, and Jane Reece. **Biology** 11th ed. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing, Menlo Park, CA

- We will also be using the MasteringBiology companion online as a component of your IHOP grade (see below). In addition to the required/assigned content, I strongly encourage you to take advantage of the myriad additional resources available in the online companion (e.g., practice problems). [Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17yVWFe9zlXYtiq2JqQyJHAt_k1bVz5uFxi8Vl-Hjqe0/edit?usp=sharing) for instructions on setting up an account. The Course ID for this course is: **MBFISHER05546 TODO**.

- Morgan, Judith and Eloise Carter 2011. **Investigating Biology Laboratory Manual**, 9th ed. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing, Menlo Park, CA

- Access to a computer, printer, and the internet, including D2L course pages (the course and many assignments will largely be administered and/or managed via D2L). Several computer labs are available for students at all PCC campuses. (eg. library in Bldg 9, Student Learning Center, Bldg. 7, and Resources centers, 1st floor Bldg. 7).

#### Socrative

- We will take advantage of a student response system called [Socrative](https://b.socrative.com/login/student/). The Room Name is **FISHER2070**. We will be using this tool to assess your (collective and personal) comprehension of topics in real time in the classroom. I'll be designing questions that I'll ask during lecture and lab and posting them to the room on Socrative. You'll be able to answer these questions from any browser or from the [ios or Android app](https://www.socrative.com/apps.html) downloaded onto your phone or tablet. If you can, please bring such a device to class every day. **If you are unable to do this, please let me know as soon as possible**.


### Strongly Recommended

- Jump drive or cloud storage such as Google Drive
- Calendar or day planner
- Many students have found it very useful to keep a set of colored pencils or pens for various uses during lecture and lab class
- _A Photographic Atlas for the Biology Laboratory_ Van de Graaf. 2007. Morton Publishing, Englewood, Colorado.



### Optional
- TODO *Student Study Guide* (Workbook to go with Campbell). Taylor, M. and/orWebsite access that comes with the new textbook or can be purchased separately.
- Plan to access to other high-quality educational and library resources including those recommended in class and/or posted at D2L.- Goggles and gloves are provided in the lab, but if you prefer to use your own, please bring these.

### Table of Graded Materials

|Graded Component|Description|Total Points|Where to Find/Submit the Item|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Exams|Exams will be based upon the guided learning that is expected to take place during the lectures, with support of this learning taking place though a variety of other means, including textbook reading, class activities, homework, laboratory exercises, supplementary reading, MasteringBiology online assignments and activities, and more. There will be 3 regular exams. Your lowest score of these 3 exams will be dropped. Because I drop your lowest exam score, no early or make up exams will be given. There are **no exceptions**. More details below. 2 @ 150 pts. each|300 pts.|In class|
|Final Exam|The final exam will have the same format, with questions that ask you to use, remember, and consider all course material, with about 25% emphasis on the final two weeks of the term. You must take the final exam to pass the class. **You may not drop your final exam score**. Makeup exams for the final exam will be given only under very extenuating circumstances and only upon prompt notification of the instructor. It is likely that a makeup final exam will not be same exam taken by the rest of the class. It may be in long-answer or essay format, to be determined at the discretion of the instructor. It is not to your advantage to take a makeup final exam for trivial reasons, but if you are genuinely too ill to take the exam at the scheduled time, let me know as soon as possible. Keep in mind that grades are due soon after the final exam date, so time will be limited.|200 pts.|In class|
|Biology Study Skills|These assignments are designed to help you learn methods to help you succeed in this class and in future classes. Please see [TODO here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i1d9N6OxcFaSIhcMX2pY9y0dqOKbdLDBZ-U2L0c-PnM/edit?usp=sharing) for more information |30 pts.|D2L|
|In-class assignments, homework, online assignments on Pearson, participation (IHOP)|In order to promote active learning and to practice applying what you’re learning, there will be homework and in-class assignments throughout the term. Some of these will be small group discussion-based critical thinking assignments. You must be in class to participate and receive credit for these in-class assignments. In-class assignments cannot be made up. Weekly online "chapter quizzes" will also be assigned via the Pearson Mastering Biology online companion. You will have six attempts, and your score will be an average of them. Late submission of this online homework will follow the policy described in the “Late Assignments” section.|200 pts.|In class for Socrative and hand-written acitvities, on MasteringBiology for online Pearson assignments|

### Additional details about graded materials
- *Exams*
	- Unless otherwise announced, you will have a class period (1hr 50min) to take each exam. The format of each exam will include a combination of multiple-choice, matching, diagraming and short answer questions. Please take care of restroom needs before the exam; if you have to use the restroom, I will require you to leave your phone in my custody. If you arrive late to an exam, you will only have the time remaining to complete the exam. If you arrive to an exam so late that some people have finished, you will not be able to take the exam. If you have a cell phone out during an exam, it will be considered cheating.
	- Students rarely have the chance to ruminate on past answers and consider potential mistakes, which is a shame, because it's a great learning tool. Thus, upon completion of the exam, you will have the opportunity to re-take the exam with a partner with open notes and open internet. You will have _one week_ to turn in your "what I should have said" (WISHeS) exam. You won't have access to your original answers until after you've turned in your WISHeS exam. **10% of the difference between your score on this version and your original score will be added to your original score**.
- *Laboratory*
    - Biology 212 is a laboratory science class. Therefore, you cannot pass the class without passing the lab portion.  If a student earns less than 60% in the lab, he or she will receive an F for the class regardless of his or her score in lecture. Students who have more than 2 lab absences will receive an F for the class. 
    - Students who fail to follow safety requirements (eg. bring food/drink into the lab, wearing open toed shoes, not wearing gloves or goggles when required) will receive one warning.  If the violation cannot be immediately rectified (eg. wearing open-toed shoes) and poses a significant safety risk, the student might be required to refrain from participating in certain lab activities and will lose points accordingly. 
    - If you are unable to attend lab as scheduled, you have one option for making up the missed lab: attend the other Rock Creek campus BI212 lab class during the same week. To do this, contact the other lab instructor ahead of time to obtain permission. Inform me of this plan, then attend the lab session, take the quiz, and participate as a student in that session the same week. You may do this one time only during the term. If you do not attend lab during a given week, it is considered to be a lab absence and you will receive a zero for that quiz, and you will lose participation points.  
    - The laboratory session is the part of class where you learn by direct observation and by asking questions, designing experiments, handling biological and chemical material, and using equipment. Note that this course includes undergraduate research that will encourage students to practice science by doing science. This will include, but not be limited to, researching primary literature, designing experiments, making collaborative decisions, using instrumentation, conducting peer review, analyzing data, and writing in a specific scientific style.
    - *Lab Exercises and Participation* Reading, studying, and preparing for activities before you come to class is vital for success in the course, and part of this will involve communication with peers outside of class time. You are expected to perform the lab work cooperatively with your group. In addition to the written materials, you will also be graded on preparedness, participation, safety compliance, cleanliness, and teamwork with your group. After the lab quiz, I will let you know what is required for your participation grade that week. You will lose points if you are late or leave without checking in with me. Thus, it is very much in your interest to be fully engaged, work at an appropriate pace, and leave only when your work is done. Generally, I will ask you some questions, look over written work, and will “sign off” on your work at the end of each lab period as a record of your participation. Sometimes, you may have written work to submit. I will announce this at the beginning of a given lab, but you should also be able to check D2L for occasional supplemental handouts. Your lab participation scores will be earned from successful completion of these tasks.
- *Scientific Research project*
    - Look for the prompt on D2L and ask questions as needed to ensure that you understand the requirements.
- *Lab quizzes*
    - There will be a quiz each Wednesday at the beginning of lab. Quizzes will cover the previous lab activities and will **also include questions that refer to the current lab activities**. The best way to earn quiz points is to make sure that you are able to discuss and explain the lab activity’s goals, independent and dependent variables, background, methods used, and results before you leave each lab session. The focus of these quizzes is on **comprehension** rather than memorization, but knowledge of terms and organism names introduced in the lab protocol or handout are also essential. Please work cooperatively with your group to answer the lab manual study questions at the end of each unit to ensure you understood everything in that unit. The lab manual answers will not be submitted and graded. Instead, the quiz will be used to assess how much you learned; these are done alone. **Read and study each lab activity before you do it**. Use your textbook as a resource if you need additional information to support your study of the lab concepts. You will have the first 10-15 minutes of lab time to complete the quiz. If you are late, you will only have the time remaining to complete it, and if you are more than ten minutes late, you cannot take the quiz. There will be no make-up lab quizzes except as part of a complete makeup lab attendance as described in the Attendance section. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.
-*Cat Genetics Assignment* 
	– This is a project that you will begin during the first lab period.  You will work as a team to perform the ongoing experiment over the following two weeks, and will use the data you collected when we get to the topic of population genetics during lecture. This will require coordinating work and communication done outside of class time to collect data and perform various activities.

## Course Policies

### Attendance

- Lecture
    - For BI 211, a key ingredient to your success will be attendance. It is your responsibility to arrive at lecture on time and prepared to learn. There will occasionally be very low-stakes assignments that are completed in class. You answers to Socrative questions during class will be tracked (although there will be no penalty for incorrect responses) and will contribute to your IHOP score. You must be in class to complete these assignments and to receive credit for them. There will be no makeup assignments – no exceptions. With that said, you are an adult, and if you feel confident in your ability to teach yourself the lecture material, it is still technically possible to be quite successful in the class without attending lecture (although I wouldn't recommend it).

- Lab
    - There will be 10 lab exercises. **If you do not attend lab session that week, you will receive a zero for that lab's participation (6 pts.) and the quiz due that week (you're welcome to attempt the quiz the following week, even though you missed the content)**.    - Lab session makeup policy:  
	    - If you are unable to attend lab as scheduled, you may take it with another lab class that week as long as you make arrangements in advance and have a reason that is acceptable to the instructor. You must email 2 people to obtain permission as follows (include both in the same email): 1) me 2) the other Rock Creek BI 211 instructor of the lab you want to attend. Please coordinate this at least a day before you attend that lab. The other instructor is not required to let you attend their lab. Instructor names can be found on the course schedule at the PCC website. **You may do this only once per term**. You will take the quiz and participate in activities in the lab you attend. The instructor will then give your quiz to me. Try to avoid switching sections the weeks of the amylase experiment planning and experiment execution. If you do have to switch, please be sure to make arrangements with your amylase experiment partners.  
    - Per departmental policy, students who have more than 2 lab absences will receive an F for the class.

### Late Assignments

All homework assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date; I accept paper or electronic submissions, but have a **strong preference for submissions being turned in on D2L to keep them in the same place** and to streamline the grading. If you turn materials in late on the date due, even if you are just tardy, they will be marked down up to 10%. Late assignments will be marked down 10% each class day after the due date. Late assignments will not be accepted after 1 week past their due date unless there are extenuating circumstances. No late materials will be accepted after the last day of class.

Late assignments will be accepted for full credit under extenuating circumstances, such as when you miss class due to illness. These are considered “excused absences” **if you communicate and explain promptly**. Showing up the next week and turning in the assignment and simply saying, "Oh yeah, I was sick last week. *Cough cough*." is not an example of prompt communication and explanation.

### Extra Credit

There will be no extra credit opportunities. This is biology department-wide policy at PCC.

### Regrade Policy
If you wish to dispute a grade, I will consider your request up to one full week after the assignment has been returned to you and you have access to solutions (whichever happens later). Requests for grade adjustments beyond the one-week deadline will not be considered.Re-grade requests for assignments and exams will be handled online. In order for a re-grade to be considered, you must message me the following:1. Which question you want addressed2. What your answer was (exactly!). Photo or physical evidence may be required.3. Detailed justification for point recoveryAny requests that do not include ALL THREE things WILL NOT be reviewed. I use this re-grade policy because sometimes writing about the question helps students realize where the mistake was (this is certainly the case for me when I write about things), and it gives students time to write more diplomatic emails (and me more time to truly consider the request and write diplomatic responses).This means that after-class re-grade ambushes will be met with frowns.

## Additional Logistics

### Course Reminders
**Students must pass BI 211 with a C or above to be admitted into courses for which BI 211 is a prerequisite**.Please be sure to speak with your instructor and an advisor if you are planning to transfer BI 211 credits to another college or university. In most cases, Principles of Biology courses 211-213 are not equivalent across institutions. It is generally best to take all three at the same place to avoid missing critical knowledge that you will need in your 300 level coursework.

### Academic Courtesy
Please demonstrate respect for fellow students during the class period. Please keep in mind that your classmates may have beliefs and opinions that differ from your own. I expect you to show courtesy towards everyone.

Refrain from talking and other distracting behavior during lecture.

Please come to class on time. If you do come to class late, please try to be as unobtrusive as possible. If you must leave early, sit near the exit and try to wait for a break to leave. Leaving in the middle of lecture can be very disruptive.

Please feel free to have food and drink in the classroom as long as it is not disruptive; the same is **not** true of lab, of course.

Students are expected to help maintain the appearance of the classroom. Please discard all trash. This is Portland - y'all know the Leave No Trace mantra.

As you might imagine, we instructors get a ton of emails containing questions that could easily be answered by looking at this document or referring to announcements made online. **As a courtesy to me, please make sure that these information sources have been checked before you email me with logistical questions**. I reserve the right to reply with, "see syllabus" or "see announcements".

### Photography, video, and audio recording
Video and audio recording of lectures or class activities is not allowed except under approved circumstances such as for legally-required learning accommodations. Photographing, video-, or audio-recording a classmate or instructor without their permission is considered a violation of privacy and is not allowed.  
Photographing biological specimens or lab instrumentation is allowed and encouraged in the context of our learning activities.


### Academic Integrity
Students are expected to be honest and ethical in their academic work. Cheating, plagiarism, falsifying, and working with others to cheat are all forms of academic dishonesty. This includes submitting work that is identical (or nearly so, based on the judgment of the instructor) to that of another student, even when completed in the context of “group” work. Various penalties may be imposed and a fair hearing process is in place. Refer to Academic Integrity Policy, which is in the Students’ Rights and Responsibilities Handbook, accessible from the PCC home page under Resources.
[Code of Student Conduct](www.pcc.edu/about/policy/student-rights/student-rights.pdf#code-of-student-conduct)
I am happy to meet with you to discuss this if you have questions or concerns, but please make sure they’re addressed before you begin any work for this class. The Writing Center also provides tutors who can help you with any writing related challenges.

### FERPA
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) protects the education records of any student who has ever enrolled at PCC.PCC and I as your instructor are committed to treating every student as a respected member of our community of learners. If you have any concerns or questions, please come see me. If I cannot answer your question, I will help you find answers.

### Sanctuary College
PCC is a sanctuary college. For more information, see [www.pcc.edu/resources/undocumented-students/](www.pcc.edu/resources/undocumented-students/).

### Dropping/Withdrawing and Grade Options
Pay attention to the college deadlines for withdrawing from the course or electing a P/NP or Audit option. You are responsible for learning what the options are, and exercising them within the designated time period. A "W" grade will be granted to the student who has followed established school procedures for properly withdrawing from the course within the specified time limits (consult your PCC Schedule of Classes).You may change to Audit or Pass/No Pass up until the dates specified in the schedule of classes.

### Title IX/Non-Discrimination statement
Portland Community College is committed to creating and fostering a learning and working environment based on open communication and mutual respect. If you believe you have encountered sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual assault, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, age, national origin, veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability please contact the Office of Equity and Inclusion at (971) 722-5840 or equity.inclusion@pcc.edu.

### Incompletes
A student may receive an I for a course if they miss an essential part of the class for a documented reason acceptable to the instructor (trips out of town for vacation, family reunions, or work are not acceptable reasons). To be eligible for an incomplete, the student must have completed 90% of the course with a grade of C or better. The I grade is not substitution for substandard performance. To receive an I, the student and the instructor must sign a written agreement and submit a copy with the division administrative staff.

### Students with Disabilities
 PCC is committed to supporting all students. If you plan to use academic accommodations for this course, you must meet with the instructor privately and in-person to discuss your needs. Accommodations are not retroactive; they can only after you meet with the instructor and the instructor receives the “Approved Academic Accommodations” letter. To request academic accommodations for a disability, please contact a disability services counselor on any PCC campus. Additional information may be located at [www.pcc.edu/resources/disability](www.pcc.edu/resources/disability).

### Tips for success in the course

- Ask questions and respect your classmates' rights to ask questions. Asking questions is a hallmark of good science! Every student should feel comfortable asking questions. Don't give up if you feel you don't know what to ask. Learning how to communicate effectively should be one of your goals in a science class. Everyone gets "stuck" at one time or another. Effectively asking questions to help settle your confusion is a very useful and achievable skill. It also happens to be a trait of a good scientist! At the same time, please respect that there is a very long list of topics that we must get through during the course; if the questions don't pertain directly to the course content, perhaps they are better suited for discussions outside of class.

- Science doesn't come naturally to most people; it is a skill, not a talent. If this is your first collegiate science course, you might be surprised at the amount of **time required to be successful**. Typically for every 1 hour a student is in a classroom lecture, they should be putting in 3 hours of homework on assignments, reading, and study time. This means that you should **carve out about 9 hours a week** to devote to reading, reviewing and completing assignments outside of the time spent with me in the classroom. This can vary for each student depending on how effectively you use your time and how well you comprehend the reading, but it should give you an idea of a typical college course expectation.

- Work hard during lectures. This work does not involve writing, word for word, everything that is said. Consider instead the strategy of taking sketchy notes during class, which frees up limited attention space for listening, participating, and thinking about the topics discussed.

- Following class, flesh out your notes, adding as much detail as possible. This forces a re-thinking of the discussion, putting the concepts in an order that makes sense to you.

- Make a list of questions as you study your notes and read the textbook. Ask these questions during lecture or lab, or ask another student while you're studying.

- Use the chapter objectives provided as a study guide. These review questions will highlight what is most important to focus on in the text. If any of my objectives for a unit go beyond those mentioned in the textbook, I will make you aware of that.

- Speaking of the chapter objectives, it might not hurt to have those out during lecture, so that you can write notes directly associating material with its objective(s)

- Form study groups! Study groups can help everyone, whether you are doing well or are doing poorly. Use your study group to quiz each other and offer short t    eaching demos to each other on particular topics; you never truly appreciate what you know and don't know until you have to teach it to somebody else.
